# Giveaways

Giveaways module was made for some old [ImpressCMS](https://impresscms.org) 2.0 alpha with some merges from experimental branches. Sadly, this code wasn't updated in years but probably could be reused as base for new projects.

It was created for generating widgets that could be included on Games.lt website for MMO giveaways.
